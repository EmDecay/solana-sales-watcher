# solana-sales-watcher
Solana sales bot, written in Python.  The initial idea/concept was a collaboration with oink_capital, however the bot has been significantly improved and enhanced since then.  It depends on the libraries in the *requirements.txt* file, with the addition of https://github.com/samuelvanderwaal/metaplex_decoder_py (which is essentially a wrapper around Rust deserialization code necessary for the bot to properly get the metadata it needs).

The current iteration of Tweet code is unfinished; I plan on completing it pretty soon, but for now, the bot will collect and store sales in a SQLite database.  Once functional, the Tweet code will run separate from the code to gather sales; this allows the code to be modular and run in containers or a k8s cluster if you so desire (this has not yet been tested, but is the intent).  The Twitter code is a combination of a previous, much crappier version of Twitter code that I wrote with some significant enhancements by 0xBanana.  It is close to functional but not there yet.
